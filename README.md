# 🚆 Smart Transportation Fare System (Strategy Pattern)  

Welcome to the **Smart Transportation Fare System!** 🎉  
This hands-on activity will help you understand and apply the **Strategy Pattern** in **C#** by building a **dynamic fare calculation system** for different transportation types.  

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
Your city is launching a **smart public transport system** where users can travel using:  
✅ **Buses** (Fixed fare)  
✅ **Taxis** (Distance-based fare)  
✅ **Trains** (Peak hour pricing applied)  

Each mode of transport has a **different fare calculation strategy**, and we will use the **Strategy Pattern** to switch between them dynamically.  

---

## 🎯 **Learning Outcomes**  
By completing this challenge, you will:  
✔ Understand and implement the **Strategy Pattern** in C#.  
✔ Learn how to **decouple business logic** and make it **scalable**.  
✔ Gain hands-on experience with **object-oriented programming**.

## 🛠 **Step-by-Step Instructions**  

### **1️⃣ Step 1: Define the Strategy Interface (Fare Calculation)**
📌 **Your Task:**  
1. Create an **interface** that defines a method for calculating fares.  
2. This interface should allow **different pricing strategies** to be implemented easily.  

---

### **2️⃣ Step 2: Implement Different Fare Strategies**
📌 **Your Task:**  
1. Implement a **Bus Fare Strategy** that uses a fixed rate (ignores distance).  
2. Implement a **Taxi Fare Strategy** that calculates the fare based on distance traveled.  
3. Implement a **Train Fare Strategy** that applies an extra charge during peak hours.  

🎯 **Challenge:** Add a **Discounted Fare Strategy** for students and senior citizens!  

---

### **3️⃣ Step 3: Create a Transport Context That Uses a Strategy**
📌 **Your Task:**  
1. Create a **transport fare calculator class** that can **accept and switch between different fare strategies dynamically**.  
2. Ensure that users can **choose their transportation type at runtime**.  

🎯 **Challenge:** Allow users to **input their transport type & get a fare estimate!**  

---

### **4️⃣ Step 4: Test the Strategy Pattern in Action**
📌 **Your Task:**  
1. In the **Main Method**, allow users to **select their transport type**.  
2. Apply the **correct fare strategy** dynamically.  
3. Display the **calculated fare based on distance & peak hours**.  

🎯 **Bonus Challenge:** Implement a **GUI version** where users can click to select their transport mode!  

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**
✔ **Strategy Pattern is correctly implemented**.  
✔ **Fare calculation dynamically switches between strategies**.  
✔ **Code is flexible—new fare strategies can be added easily**.  

🚀 **Great job! You’ve built a flexible, real-world fare system using the Strategy Pattern!**
